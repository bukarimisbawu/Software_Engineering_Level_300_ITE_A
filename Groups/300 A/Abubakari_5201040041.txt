Q1.
a.	Software Process Model: is an abstract representation of a process that present a description of a process from a particular perspective.
b.	 
i.	 It provides visual representation of the development process for both the team and the customers to review.
ii.	It helps the team to identify which process to follow for a specific software.
iii.	It helps the team to identify early challenges or cost constraints and acts as a record for the team’s future development process.

Q2. 
a.	 similarities
i.	Both go through the same processes of building a software.
ii.	Both have similar goal of producing high quality software application for their client.

b.	 Difference
i.	In the waterfall model, a complete system is delivered to the customers whereas in the Agile model, the software deliverables are progressive and iterative.
ii.  Waterfall model provides little or no room for changes to made after a phase is completed however, in the Agile model it is easier to change the process to reflect the changing customer requirement. 
iii.	The Waterfall model has separate and distinct phases of specification but in the Agile model, specification and validation are inter-leaved.


      c.
            i. Benefits of the waterfall process model
•	It determines the end goal
•	It ensures that projects are managed in a well-structured manner
•	Has clear defined stages and easy to arrange tasks
        ii. drawbacks of the Waterfall process model
•	It is difficult to accommodate changes when the process is underway
•	It is only appropriate for requirements that are clearly defined and understood
•	No working software is developed until the development cycle is complete
       iii. Benefits of the Agile process model 
•	it is easier to get customer feedback on development of work that has been done
•	there is more rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer
•	there is lower risk of overall project failure
     iv. Drawbacks of the Agile process model          
•	it requires a software deliverable at every stage or version of the software development
•	the process is not visible
•	the system structure tends to degrade as new increments are added
Q3. 
	a. 
  	i. Meaning of Rational Unified Process(RUP): Is a modern generic process derived from the work on UML and associated process. It uses diagram to extensively build a model of a software and also incorporates the three generic software development models.
ii. How RUP differ from other software development process models
  It incorporates aspects of the three other generic models into its processes 
b. PHASES AND ACTIVITIES OF RUP
    Phases of the RUP
     - Inception
     - Elaboration
     - Construction
     - Transition 
   Activities of RUP   
    - Business model
    - Requirement
    - Analysis and design
    - Implementation
    - Testing
    - Deployment
C. Benefits and Drawbacks of RUP   
   i. Benefits of RU
     - Allow for changes to requirements to be made regardless to where its coming from
    - It emphasis the need for accurate documentation 
    - It enhances integration throughout the software development. 
DRAWBACKS OF RUP
-	It’s a complex model to implement
-	It is challenging for organization to implement 
-	It is highly result oriented from the individuals or teams
